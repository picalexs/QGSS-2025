    "This exercise demonstrates how to use Qiskit’s quantum portfolio optimizer function to solve financial portfolio optimization problems. We show how to formulate and solve dynamic portfolio optimization problems in a simple and accessible way, making it suitable for execution on a quantum computer or simulator with no quantum computing expertise required. The objective is to illustrate how quantum algorithms apply to real-world financial problems using intuitive tools and workflows provided by Qiskit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we also show how to fine-tune the quantum portfolio optimizer settings. Although this fine-tuning is not necessary for basic usage, these advanced options provide insights into how experienced users can leverage quantum computing to improve efficiency and accuracy. For further details, consult the [documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/global-data-quantum-optimizer) of the global data quantum portfolio optimizer.\n"

    "The dynamic portfolio optimization problem involves determining the optimal investment strategy over multiple time periods in order to maximize the expected return of the portfolio and minimize risks, often under certain constraints such as transaction costs, or risk aversion. Unlike standard portfolio optimization, which considers a single time to rebalance the portfolio, the dynamic version accounts for the evolving nature of assets and rebalance the investment based on changes in asset performance over time.\n",

Additionally, we introduce a penalty term to enforce the maximum investment per asset.\n",
